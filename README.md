#  ZK SNARK Designer

In this project , I have  design a new zkSNARK circuit that implements some logical operations using the circom programming language

## Description

In this , I code a circuit.circom by using the circuit and deploy it on matic network and verify it transaction on polygonscan(mumbai).


### Executing program

after Cloning the repo , you need to follow these steps:
1. In the template, run the command 'npx hardhat circom'
2. Then, npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai

Above two step will verify the project and you can copy the address and check on the polygonscan(mumbai) whether the code is verified or not.
